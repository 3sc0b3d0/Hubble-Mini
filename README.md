# Hubble-Mini

Hello! Welcome to my first, solo front-end project. I am using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and a tiny bit of JavaScript in order to re-create the original Hubblesite to the best of my ability. 

This project is a part of the Bootstrap section in the NuCamp bootcamp for the full-stack track.

Happy coding,
Mariana
